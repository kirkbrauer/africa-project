<p>
  From the months of April to July in 1994, the Hutu ethnicity group killed over 800,000 people, mostly the tutsi population. The Hutu nationalists had started this genocide and the brutality and violence spread among the whole country. The Tutsis were oppressed and taken from their homes. If they denied the request of a Hutu, they would be killed immediately. In the end the Tutsis were able to take control using a military offense and killed many Hutus.  This led to the collapse of Rwanda. Â¾ of the Tutsis were killed and an enormous amount of Hutus were also banished.
