<h2>Rivalry in the Horn of Africa</h2>
<p>
  The Soviet Union and the US came into Africa with different government ideas. The Soviet Union wanted communism while the US tried to prevent it. The two world powers invaded the horn of Africa with their different political ideas and money. Some people liked the idea of communism while others didnâ€™t. This caused rivalries in the Horn of Africa.
