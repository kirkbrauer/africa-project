<h2>Nelson Mandela</h2>
<p>
  Nelson Mandela was an anti-apartheid leader who eventually became the president of South Africa. He stood up for the African people and believed it was wrong for Africans to  be treated so poorly. He ultimately ended apartheid but went to prison for 27 years due to his resistance against the government.
