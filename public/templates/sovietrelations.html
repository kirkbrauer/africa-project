<h2>Soviet Relations with Africa</h2>
<p>
  The different dictators and the African people did not get along very well. These dictators treated many of the African people poorly which created many issues.  At this time, the African economy was very poor, which prevented governments from controlling their people. The Soviet Union came into Africa wanting to help the people make their economy good again. The Soviet Union hoped if they gave money to the people, they would become communist.
