<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  When the Europeans arrived in the area soon to be called Rwanda, they separated it's people into groups. The group that they thought were the natural leaders were the Tutsis. Therefore, the europeans put the Tutsis in power of the puppet government. To keep the distinction, all people in Rwanda were given ID cards with their group listed on it. This later came back to bite the people of Rwanda, as it made the future genocide possible. When the Europeans left during decolonization, the Hutus rose to power. This new Hutu-led goverment started to opress Tutsis and began to kill them in the event called the Rwandan Genocide.
