<h2>You are a Tutsi</h2>
<p>
  You are a Tutsi and ever since the Hutus rose to power after decolonization, you have been exposed to harsh opression and descrimination. Oppressed means subjected to harsh and unfair treatment. Your people are killed in your home and if you are a woman you are  also raped. Even if you are suspected of being a Tutsi, you will be killed. This systematic oppression and genocide is leading to the demise of your people.
