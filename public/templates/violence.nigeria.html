<h2>Nigerian Ethnic Violence</h2>
<p>
  After Nigeria had gained independence in 1960, the different ethnic groups were experiencing conflicts with each other. The government had been taken control by the military because Nigeria was having issues governing itself. The Igbo people felt they were not able to coexist with this government. Therefore, a civil war broke out between the multiple ethnic groups who felt they were being overpowered.
